	doi = {10.1109/EVS.2013.6914921},
	abstract = {The paper presents an analysis of the ongoing battery electric vehicles (BEV) revolution in Norway focusing on the measures that have been introduced to support a modal shift away from the classical motor car. Different policy measures, BEV infrastructure and EV technology developments and their coherence are examined. The paper also looks into the situation for BEV in some other European countries before lessons learned are drawn. A list of policies that needs to be in place before one could expect a BEV takeoff in a given country is also presented. In total there were more than 9,500 BEVs and 330 Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) driving on Norwegian roads by the end of 2012-an increase of 4.679 in 2012 alone. BEVs and PHEVs amounted to about 3.1 percent of sales of new passenger cars. The corresponding figure for 2011 was 1.6 percent. In August 2013, BEVs alone accounted for over 6\% of new car sales. If this trend continues, there could be more than 50.000 electric cars in Norway by the end of 2016. So how did this EV-revolution in Norway come about? The paper looks at policy measure, infrastructure developments and technology drivers which can help explain the rapid development seen in the Norwegian marketplace. This paper also examines the market penetration and the main differences in BEV policies in Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Portugal and Ireland. In the end a 3-step lesson to be learned for other countries are presented - with the Norwegian example as the starting point.},

This study is a part of a PhD research project; it presents a part of its overall methodology, which will be employed in a smaller-scale pilot project to obtain initial findings. An agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) technique is proposed to represent the phenomenon and analyze it. This study covers the development of the model, emphasizing how it would reflect Electric Vehicles (EVs) current users' behaviours and their charging habits. The aim of the PhD research is to examine whether the current electric-mobility charging infrastructure can support current users and whether it can accommodate future potential users or if the planning authorities and policy makers need to forecast and plan for more charging points. This in return shall potentially provide a better accessibility to e-mobility and support its market, partly by better informed location decision making.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the strategies of the most relevant stakeholders with regard to the development and commercialization of electric vehicles (EVs) and their recharging infrastructure. Building on the perspective of socio-technical transitions, we relate the strategies of stakeholders to their current and future interests, as well as to their expectations with regard to EVs. Our analysis is based on a series of 38 semi-structured interviews with representatives of a variety of stakeholders in the Netherlands.

EVs pose both opportunities and threats to various stakeholders. They therefore participate in the development of the emerging EV system, primarily in order to learn about the potential positive and negative impacts of these systems on their interests and, ultimately, to be able to grasp the opportunities and mitigate the threats. In other words, the expectations, interests, and resulting strategies of stakeholders relate to and depend upon the specific configuration of the emerging socio-technical system for electric mobility. We identify six potential conflicts of interest: the division of tasks within a public recharging infrastructure; the allocation of charging spots; the ways in which charging behavior can be influenced; the role of fast-charging, technical standards for charging equipment; and supportive policies for full-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.

In general, the stakeholders do not seem overly concerned about either short-term returns on investments or long-term negative impacts. In this regard, the early phase of the transition can be understood as a relatively carefree phase. In order to continue the development of the emerging EV system and to keep it on the right track, however, for the foreseeable future, supportive policies will be necessary in order to provide a stable and reliable basis for further market expansion.},

Charger systems are categorized into off-board and on-board types with unidirectional or bidirectional power flow. Unidirectional charging limits hardware requirements and simplifies interconnection issues. Bidirectional charging supports battery energy injection back to the grid. Typical on-board chargers restrict power because of weight, space, and cost constraints. They can be integrated with the electric drive to avoid these problems. The availability of charging infrastructure reduces on-board energy storage requirements and costs. On-board charger systems can be conductive or inductive. An off-board charger can be designed for high charging rates and is less constrained by size and weight. Level 1 (convenience), Level 2 (primary), and Level 3 (fast) power levels are discussed. Future aspects such as roadbed charging are presented. Various power level chargers and infrastructure configurations are presented, compared, and evaluated based on amount of power, charging time and location, cost, equipment, and other factors.},

The development of electric vehicles (EVs) is one of the solutions to tackle those problems due to its special and profound significance for moderating global energy crisis, optimizing environmental protection and realizing the sustainable development. In this paper, the status quo, technical researches and goals of EV development in China are introduced firstly. Accordingly it addresses that the development of EVs is faced with tremendous obstacles and challenges as a result of the immature technologies and markets in China. Therefore, the further research and development of EVs is required so as to greatly promote sustainable development of Chinese automobile industry, and China has a unique opportunity to become a pioneer in this nascent but rapidly growing market.},
